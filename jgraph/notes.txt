Design goals



- Graph data structure scaleable up to social network size (200 million nodes, 20 billion edges) on commodity hardware
  - Will require persistence; can't expect to fit nodes + edges + attributes in memory at this size!
- Highly efficient memory usage
  - bit packed

- Multithread and multiprocess safe (using shared memory for locks?)
- Multiprocessing safe

- Atomic operations redit

- Look at ideas from

- strings stored as atoms

- inferred schemas

- Attribute types
  - Probabilities
  - Real, boolean values
  - Distributions (probability)
  - Vector-space representation
  - Natural language text (converted to vector space)
  - others?
  - Arbitrarily structured data
  - Accessible via key

- Set and list data structures
